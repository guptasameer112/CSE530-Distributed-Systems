This file contains functions for sending and handling RPC messages such as 
RequestVote and AppendEntries. 
It also includes serialization and deserialization logic for RPC messages.

def serialize_request_vote_request(candidate_id, candidate_term, last_log_index, last_log_term):
    '''
    This function serializes a RequestVote RPC message into a byte string.
    Args:
        candidate_id (int): The unique identifier of the candidate requesting the vote.
        candidate_term (int): The term for which the candidate is requesting the vote.
        last_log_index (int): The index of the candidate's last log entry.
        last_log_term (int): The term of the candidate's last log entry.
    Returns:
        bytes: The serialized RPC message.

    Returns:
        Tuple[int, int, int, int]: A tuple containing the candidate_id, candidate_term, last_log_index, and last_log_term fields.

    '''
    This function serializes an AppendEntries RPC message into a byte string.
    Args:
        leader_id (int): The unique identifier of the leader sending the RPC.
        leader_term (int): The term of the leader sending the RPC.
        prev_log_index (int): The index of the log entry preceding the new entries.
        prev_log_term (int): The term of the log entry preceding the new entries.
        entries (list): The log entries to append to the receiver's log.
        leader_commit (int): The index of the leader's commit point.
