This file contains the definition of the RaftNode class and functions related to the core Raft logic such as 
handling elections, 
processing AppendEntries RPCs, 
and managing the node's state.

class RaftNode:

        This function handles a RequestVote RPC received from another node.
        It should check if the candidate's log is at least as up-to-date as the receiver's log, and grant or deny the vote accordingly.
        Args:
            candidate_id (int): The unique identifier of the candidate requesting the vote.
            candidate_term (int): The term for which the candidate is requesting the vote.
            last_log_index (int): The index of the candidate's last log entry.
